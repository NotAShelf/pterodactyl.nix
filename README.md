# pterodactyl.nix

Packaging attempt and an experiment with Pterodactyl in Nix/NixOS environments.
Provides packages for Pterodactyl and Pelican panel Wings daemon, and a module
for setting up Pterodactyl panel _frontend_.

Not yet production ready, although testing is always welcome. Documentation is a
work in progress, please feel free to ask any question you might have in the
issues tab.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. I invite you to open pull requests instead of
creating diverging forks, as the idea for this flake to eventually upstream into
Nixpkgs.
